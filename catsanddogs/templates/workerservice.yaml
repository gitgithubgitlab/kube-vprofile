# worker does not have a service
# worker is built on dotnet
# it directly connects to redis to get the data and inputs that to the db
# once the worker app is deployed, it keeps the connection to redis and db alive, 
# so that any updates happen in redis it collects the data and inputs that to the db.
# worker connects to the redis service --> redis and db service --> db which in turn connects to the respective applications.
